# Data Science BootCamp
# Traffic Data Exploration

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploring traffic data using Pandas and visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly in Python. The dataset includes various counts of vehicles (cars, bikes, buses, trucks) across different times and days, along with the traffic situation (e.g., normal, heavy).

## Dataset

- `Time`: Time of the data entry
- `Date`: Date of the data entry
- `Day of the week`: Day of the week
- `CarCount`: Number of cars
- `BikeCount`: Number of bikes
- `BusCount`: Number of buses
- `TruckCount`: Number of trucks
- `Total`: Total number of vehicles
- `Traffic Situation`: Traffic situation at the time of data entry (e.g., normal, heavy)

## Prerequisites

To run the notebooks, you will need:

- Python 3.x
